# bpm (Bazel package manager)

This repository will host [Bazel](https://bazel.build) configuration files for
open source libraries.

Bazel users will then easily be able to reference these from their [WORKSPACE](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/be/workspace.html)
files in order to depend on a given library version.

This project is just getting started. Get involved by joining the discussion on the [bazel-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bazel-discuss/repository$20OSS%7Csort:relevance/bazel-discuss/yisAi4YUQjc/z4GvaJZnAAAJ).
